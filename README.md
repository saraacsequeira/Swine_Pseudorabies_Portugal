# Evaluation of the effectiveness of Aujesky's Erradication Plan implementation in Portugal 🐷💻📊

Pigs are the natural host for Aujeszky’s disease herpesvirus which results in considerable economic losses in the pork production industry. To control the disease, farms may implement preventive measures such as improved stock management and vaccination throughout the pig-rearing period. 

To evaluate if this measures are being effectively implemented in Portugal and to see the effects of this implementation until date, we performed an Aujesky's data analyses with access to "New Swine Health Information System" (SISS) developed by "Directorate-General for Food and Veterinary" (DGAV).
